## Winter Ornament Workshop
Winter Break 2020

### About 
For this workshop, attendees were shipped a kit of parts and a PCB, and followed the instructions given in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8fKGx45B7o) in order to assemble it. This workshop was held asyncronously to allow for participants to complete the project on their own time over their winter break.
